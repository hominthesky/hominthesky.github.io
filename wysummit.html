        <h1 class="subtitle bold">Project Description</h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          WHF is short for WooYun WhiteHat Fest. This year, we launched a brand
          new activity theme for this grand event - "Upplugged" and aimed to
          hold a conference only with pure and real valuable security topics but
          no other pretendious stuff. Therefore Designing and buliding a
          distinguishing and innovative event home page to convey the theme of
          our conference was the first and one of the most important part.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle bold">My Role</h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          I was the interaction and visual designer to design and manage this
          project, cooperating with the front end engineer and the back end
          engineer to ensure to meet the deadline with a gorgeous,
          friendly-operated and stable website and making it adapt mobile phone
          as well.
        </p>
        <section class="divider"></section>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Why do we build a website for a conference?</h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          As always, every time before I did something, I would ask myself "why
          do I have to do that".
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          It is the same with this project. Before design, I was trying to find
          the answer for why we have to build a site for a conference. I always
          hold this opinion - if there is no need, there would be no design. So
          I came to talk with our CEO and those colleagues in marketing
          department and listened their viewpoints or their needs for the
          conference. After that, I brainstormed with partners who are also
          responsible for managing the conference, thought about what theme of
          this conference is and analysed who the potential and target audience
          is.
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          Finally I came to the conclusion, we build this website is aim to
          convey our theme and spirits to our target audience in first time, to
          inform the public of the status of our preparation and to provide an
          access to our interactive part for online users whether they could
          participate in our conference or not.
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          And most importantly, we want to attract people to join in our
          conference and convey the theme of our event.
        </p>

          FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE
        </h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          All pages have access to the ticket selling which is one of the most
          important needs from target users and us.
        </p>

          #ISSUE: Where to place the access of the ticket selling button?
        </h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          We expect that people could see the button on every page in the site.
          As a designer, I don't want this button to bother people and distract
          people from the main content. Therefore I put ticket selling button on
          the sidebar and made it always fixed in the top-right corner, so that
          people could click this button to buy tickets while they were browsing
          the description of the conference details on any page.
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          As for the style of the ticket selling button, I knew my colleagues
          and audiences really care about it, especially where it is placed on
          the home page and what it looks like (It is the shortest path to get
          tickets, so it is necessary to be highlight and avoid being ignored).
          Originally I prepared two styles for it.
        </p>
        <img src="/btn.90c9dda1.jpg" width="100%" class="center" />
        <p class="body-1">
          After testing 10 people by let them choose the one that intuitively
          looks more acttractive and eye catching, 8 people chose the second one
          other than the outline stroke style. So I choose the second one that
          is also the one I like better to be the final button style.

        <h1 style="text-align:center;" class="subtitle center">Logo Design</h1>
        <p class="body-1">
          As "Unpplugged" originates from a musical concept, I brought an
          upplugged guitar here as a part of the logo for WHF. Also, WHF is a
          technical conference with numbers of security topics, so a keyhole as
          a symbol of security and a pair of braces presenting programming
          techniques were used here to compose the logo as well.
