          <h1 class="subtitle bold">Market Background</h1>
          <p class="body-1">
            The solid and deep understanding of background and culture is vital
            for launching a new product in a new market.
          </p>
          <p class="body-1">
            By local research, firsthand experience and interviews of
            widely-ranged people in India, we learned three aspects about India:
          </p>
          <p class="body-1">
            <em>1. Technology & Network Environment: </em>There have been over
            four million users of smart phone in India till now, whose amount
            ranks the second largest in the world. The occupancy of Andriod has
            reached about 40%, the first place of OS market share. Most popular
            brands of mobile phone are Samsung and Xiaomi. Thanks to the
            well-developed and popularized 4G network, its expense is cheap.
            Thus the cost of cellular data isn't the greatest concern. And
            quality of 4G network in India is better than that of Wi-Fi, which
            means transferring data via Wi-Fi may be more unstable in India.
            This research overturns our preconceived idea.
          </p>
          <p class="body-1">
            <em>2. Indian Culture:</em> The north India is different from the
            south India by linguistically. Except for two official languages
            which are Hindi and English, there are 6 sorts of local minority
            languages, such as Tamil, Telugu, Punjab…
          </p>
          <p class="body-1">
            <em>3. User Habits:</em>
            <li class="body-1 no-indent" style="margin-top:-32px;">
              <em>Specific People - Youngsters</em> (by interview) : <br />
              - Post private instagram story to share daily life moments with
              close friends and follow celebrities' updates on public feed.
              <br />
              - Madly cling to the streak of Snapchat in order to accumulate the
              days in streak with their close friends. <br />
              - Consider Facebook products as the communities of middle & aged
              people, or family instead of their peers.
            </li>

              <em>Specific People - Indian drivers</em> (by observation and
              talk) :<br />
              - In spite of watching videos, they tend to listen to them even
              though the moment they waited at a red light. <br />
              - They can spend more than 80% of income in buying a mobile phone
              even though not earning too much.

              <em>General people</em> (by interview, observation and online
              data) : <br />

              - Contact family with WhatsApp and view their updates on
              Facebook.<br />
              - Tend to post and watch pictures or videos containing greetings
              and quotes, such as "Good Morning", "Good Night", Wishes...

                How Do I Organize the Potential Requirements
              </h1>
              <p class="body-1">
                As we know, social community is made up of two elements -
                <em>contents & people</em>. And the content-related elements can
                be organized mainly from two aspects -
                <em>content production & content consumption</em>.
              </p>
              <p class="body-1">
                Thus I selected those potential requirements and sorted them by
                three aspects of <em>consumption, production & people</em>. And
                vote to decide their priority.

              <h5 class="h5 bold">2-Step Type vs 3-Step Type</h5>
              <p class="body-1">
                I have experienced and compared many video products. And I also
                had led the experience design of video production in my past
                work. So after the comparison & first-hand experience from
                previous work, I concluded that there are mainly two types of
                production userflow - 2-Step Type and 3-Step Type. They are
                <em>Shoot-Post Type</em> and <em>Shoot-Edit-Post Type</em>.
              </p>
              <p class="body-1">
                In this time, I designed both two types of experience for Kwai
                Go India to meet different requirements from different phases.

              <p class="caption">Shoot-Post</p>
              <p class="body-1">
                2-Step Type is generally used in the early version of a product.
                Because there are only 2 steps, users can easily understand this
                design and quickly go through all the process to finish posting.
                However, its drawback is also abvious. Especially in the second
                step, video editing module and post-info editing module are put
                together, which almost occupy the whole screen. That means its
                extensibility would be very limited and it will be difficult to
                iterate and add more functions based on it.
              </p>
              <p class="body-1">
                In this way, we gradually changed 2 steps into 3 steps, the more
                powerful and complete type for a product:

                Indian people like sharing this type of contents on their social
                networks.
              </p>
              <p class="body-1">
                Based on the fact that Indian people love watching and sharing
                videos or pictures containing quotes and wishes, we decided to
                provide a simple way for users to produce this type of contents,
                including single picture, multiple pictures and videos with
                texts / stickers, to establish the production & consumption
                ecosystem.

                <p class="body-1">
                  1. I changed the slideshow in the aspect ratio of 3 : 4 into
                  the ratio of 9 : 16 to help users easily make contents which
                  are immersive to watch.<br />
                  2. I conbined the process of making slideshow into the main
                  process of making videos to reduce users' cognitive burden.
                  That means whether you make slideshow or video, the workflow
                  you experience is almost the same. The only differences
                  between them are the functions living on the left bottom of
                  the screen - Besides of adding music, setting sounds, texting,
                  adding stickers and filters, people can edit each picture
                  frame further, set the transition effects and duration of each
                  slide when they edit the slideshow.

                <em>Pros:</em> <br />
                1. Effective to consume full contents & interact with people
                directly on feed, no need to enter the child layer to see the
                details of each item. <br />
                2. Simple hierarchy ( Like instagram, both full content of each
                item and feed items lie on the same hierarchy, without the child
                hierarchy ) and easy to use. <br />

              <p class="body-1">
                <em>Cons:</em> <br />
                1. Mid effeciency for content browsing. <br />
                2. Cannot contain too much information in each item for sake of
                better effeciency, so mostly used to present small picture,
                picture collage, short pure texts or short texts with pictures.
                <br />
                3. Not immersive enough while watching. Easy to be distracted by
                other contents and actions on this feed. <br />
                4. Not friendly for full-screen-size items.

                <em>Cons:</em> <br />
                1. Low-effeciency for consumption and social interaction,
                compared with sigle column feed. Users have to enter the child
                hierarchy to see the details and actions of each content item.
                <br />
                2. Little brief information provided. Merely content with
                high-quality cover or title may attract people to tap, which is
                not friendly for new users, espacily new producer of the
                community. And it requires more editors' work or an advanced
                recomendation algorithm to pick out the proper contents with

                1. Low-effeciency to browse contents. <br />
                2. Thanks to the full-screen display, this type of feed asks for
                extraordinarily high-quality contents selected by editors.
                Otherwise, users will be not patient to watch boring videos one
                by one just to wait for the next good one. <br />
                3. Limited introduction of the content. Users may be not able to
                distinguish the quality of content until they finish watching
                the video. <br />
                4. Relatively higher costs of learning gesture to switch and
                interact with the videos for new users.

                In order to satisfy Indian users's needs for contents, we

                sake of adaptation of different types of contents, I made

                for short-video products. So in the first phase, I choose the
                double column feed to adapte the general short videos and to
                improve the browsing effeciency for the new users.
              </p>
              <p class="body-1">
                Not only to make decision of feed type, at the same time, I
                designed different styles of double-column feed for user testing
                to validate which one the best accepted is.

                Due to the work adjustment, I won't have the chance to continue
                iterating this project. To be honest, I am still carious about
                the influence of those shipped design for feed and I still want
                to know the data feedback of every past design efforts. And I
                know there is still so much work, long term work, left to do,
                for example, the content exploration, the continuous design
                iterations to adapte those changing and dynamic contents and
                further understanding of indian culture.
              </p>

                On the other hand, I have learned a lot from this project. I
                experienced a complete process of a product development for
                people from another country and culture. And I have the chance
                to lead the design of overall experience (from research, product
                requirenments analyse, interaction design, visual design and
                even data validation) to accumulate tons of experience about
                community product design.
